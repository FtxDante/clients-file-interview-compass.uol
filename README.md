#### STEP 1 - Install Dependences :hand:
```

$ git clone https://github.com/FtxDante/project1-compass.uol.git

# Go into the repository: 
$ cd project1-compass.uol

# Install dependencies:

```
#### STEP 2 - Configure the ormconfig file :warning: 
To allow you acess your database we need to setup somethings:
```json
{
	"name": "default",    			 DEFAULT (DON'T CHANGE)
	"type": "postgres",  			 DEFAULT (DON'T CHANGE)
	"host": "[YOURHOST]", 			 DEFAULT localhost
	"port": [PORT],                  DEFAULT 5432
	"username": "[YOURUSERNAME]",	 DEFAULT postgres
	"password": "[YOURPASSWORD]",    DEFAULT postgres
	"database": "[YOURDATABASE]",    DEFAULT CommonDB
}
```
In ormconfig.json, are two configurations to be defined, the first one is to production database, and the second is to test database, with you want run some test, please configure that as well.

#### STEP 3 - Running the application :running:
```
# Run migrations to your database: 
$ yarn typeorm:run

# Run the server: 
$ yarn dev
```
